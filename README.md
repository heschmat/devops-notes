# DevOps Notes

A curated collection of concise notes, mini-guides, and reference docs for various DevOps concepts. Each folder groups related topics (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform) into smaller Markdown files so knowledge stays organized and easy to navigate.

## âœ… How to Use

* Browse folders for the tool/area you're working with.
* Each concept is documented as a **separate Markdown file** (e.g., `aws-eks-kubernetes-helm.md`).
* Use subfolder `README.md` files as indexes.
* Notes are intentionally **short and practical** â€” think cheat sheets or concept primers.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Examples of Notes

* **Terraform â†’ Providers â†’** [AWS EKS with Kubernetes & Helm](terraform/providers/aws-eks-kubernetes-helm.md)
* **Docker â†’** image layers, networking, multi-stage builds
* **Kubernetes â†’** deploying workloads, configuring ingress, RBAC basics
* **CI/CD â†’** GitHub Actions workflows, GitLab CI pipelines

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This repo serves as a **personal knowledge base** for DevOps, cloud, and infra-as-code topics. Rather than one giant guide, each note is a bite-sized reference that can be quickly searched and extended over time.
